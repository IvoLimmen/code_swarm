# Resume #

This is my technical resume. I picked this project for a couple of reasons:

 * No clear packages of de code
 * One class with a s**t load of objects (code_swarm)
 * Multiple languages (Java and Python)
 * Bad use of OO (looked more like structs)
 * Presentation, configuration and XML parsing is all in one object.
 * Technically OK product, bad code

## What is a technical resume? ##

  I am a Software Engineer. This project tells more about me than my https://nl.linkedin.com/in/ivolimmen profile.

## What are you trying to show? ##

  I am showing that I can refactor bad code. That I can make software using a few basic rules:

  * Simple
  * Readable
  * Maintainable

  What you can't see is that I can do this fast and efficient, and that I can teach this also.

## Don't you mean SOLID? ##

  Fuck SOLID. Can't remember what that means. These three rules covers everything a good coder requires. Plus passion!

## Wait, where are the junit tests? ##

  I just started this project! My take on QA in software: I you are steering on a 90% code coverage you get developers 
  that write GeneralReflectionGetterSetterTest. That are not the variables you want to steer on. I only write junit test
  in my personal projects to prove difficult software. But you saw my main principles: if my software is simple it does
  not require that much junit tests.
  I much rather steer on a 100% integration test coverage.

## That does not work with technology X and/or framework Y! ##

  Yeah right.

## What will you do with this project in the future? ##

  I hope to show that I can also write usable software that is user friendly. I hope to eventually build one jar and 
  when a user starts it will show a GUI. Using that GUI the user can download a GitHub project and create a CodeSwarm,
  or he can use a local (GIT) project.
