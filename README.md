# Description #

This project is a fork of a fork of a fork. It originated at:

 * http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm with the code residing at:

Google Code Project :      http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/
Google Group/Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/codeswarm 

It then moved to GitHub where it was forked and later abandoned. To revive the project I copied it and changed a lot.
